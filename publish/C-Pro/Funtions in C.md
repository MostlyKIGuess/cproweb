- Functions are of 2 types, return and void.
- **Return** function returns the data type which it was specified in. 
- For eg, int function(){} would return an integer.
- **Void** function doesn't have to return anything, they just compile the code which was inside the function.


### Arguments and Parameters

```c
int function(int a,int b,char c,float r)
```
here int a, int b, c ,r are called arguments.
when we call the function to be used again in the main function we need to give it's parameters to it.

so if I want to use it I would call it as :
```c
int useoffunction = function(aint,b,car,road)
```
where they should be their respective data-types, function will automatically change their name to it's argument inside it's code.
