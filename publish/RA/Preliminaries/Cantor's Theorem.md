If A is any set, then there is no surjection of A onto the set P(A) of all subsets of A.

**Cantor’s theorem**, in [set theory](https://www.britannica.com/science/set-theory), the [theorem](https://www.britannica.com/topic/theorem) that the cardinality (numerical size) of a [set](https://www.britannica.com/topic/set-mathematics-and-logic) is strictly less than the cardinality of its power set, or collection of subsets. In symbols, a finite set _S_ with _n_ elements contains 2^n subsets, so that the cardinality of the set _S_ is _n_ and its power set _P_(_S_) is 2^n.
