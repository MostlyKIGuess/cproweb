[[Uniqueness Theorem]]

- (a) A set S is said to be **denumerable**(or countably infinite) if there exists a bijection of N onto S.
- (b) A set S is said to be countable if it is either finite or denumerable. 
- (c) A set S is said to be uncountable if it is not countable.

b = set of natural numbers, integers.
c = number of real numbers between 1 and 2.

### Theorem -
Suppose that S and T are sets and that T C S. 
(a) If S is a countable set, then T is a countable set. 
(b) If T is an uncountable set, then S is an uncountable set.
