- These notes are made using http://linked-blog-md.vercel.app/ and the notes are edited/linked via Obsidian.

- To use them in obsidian I have uploaded the folder already in another repo which can be found in my profile so you can easily clone from there as well.
- Oh and Btw this is the current graph :
