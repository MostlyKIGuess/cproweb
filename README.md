# C-Pro
- These notes are made using http://linked-blog-md.vercel.app/ and the notes are edited/linked via Obsidian.
- I am doing this as a fun hobby and will be keep updateing it regularly as my knowledge of C grows, it also has reference books in the home page which can be used :)
- To use them in obsidian I have uploaded the folder already in another repo which can be found in my profile so you can easily clone from there as well.
